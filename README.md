# Welcome to French C ![](https://github.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/blob/master/png/36/country-4x3/fr.png)

Bienvenue to the ultimate project for those who want to add a little "je ne sais quoi" to their coding experience! This is a project to recreate all of the classic C commands but with a French twist. Because why write 'printf' when you can write 'imprimerf'?

# Example Code

A Salut, Monde! program which is equivalent to the English Hello, World! program

````c
vide principal() {
    
    caract√®re *msg = "Salut, Monde!";

    imprimerf("%s\n", msg);
}
````

# How to Use?

It's as easy as enjoying a croissant on a Sunday morning!

- Download the FrenchLang.h header file from the repository
- Add the file to your working C code directory
- After you import all standard libraries use ```include "FrenchLang.h"```

# Contributions Welcome!

We are not perfect at French, if you see translations that aren't correct please feel free to let us know or fork the project and try to fix it yourself!
